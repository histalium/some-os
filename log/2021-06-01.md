## remove warning

when running you get this warning.

```
WARNING: Image format was not specified for 'bin/boot_sect_simple.bin' and probing guessed raw.
         Automatically detecting the format is dangerous for raw images, write operations on block 0 will be restricted.
         Specify the 'raw' format explicitly to remove the restrictions.
```

to remove it use this command

```shell
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -drive "format=raw,file=bin/boot_sect_simple.bin"
```

## debugging

debugging can be done with `gdb`. before you can debug with `gdb`, `qemu` must enable it. this can be done with the argument `-gdb tcp::8000` or `-s` can be used what is short for `-gdb tcp::1234`. to be able to debug from the beginning the argument `-S` can be used. this stops the cpu until a `continue` will be sent from `gdb`.

this changes the command to run qemu to

```shell
$ qemu-system-x86_64 -drive "format=raw,file=bin/boot_sect_simple.bin" -s -S
```

to debug with `gdb` you can start it with

```shell
$ gdb
```

connecting to `qemu` can be done with

```
(gdb) target remote localhost:1234
```

show registers

```
(gdb) info reg
```

you can add the register names you want to see

```
info reg rax rbx
```

show memory you can use `x` (examine). `/32b` shows 32 bytes. and as last the address to start the dump.

```
x/32b 0xf000
```

to add a breakpoint at address `0x7c00`

```
b *0x7c00
```

to continue running

```
c
```

one step

```
si
```
