## stack

to use the stack you must initalize it by setting `sp` and `bp`. data is added to the stack with `push` and taken from the stack with `pop`. for the data registers only the 16-bit and 32-bit rigisters can be added and taken from the stack.

```asm
; initalize stack
mov bp, 0x8000
mov sp, bp

push 'A'   ; add data to the stack
push ax    ; add register to the stack
pop bx     ; put value from the stack in a register
```
