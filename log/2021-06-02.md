## no progress

no progress today. keep failing to read sector 3. first error was `0x01` meaning `bad command passed to driver`. this was because `dl` was changed. with `dl` set to `0x00` the error changed to `0x20` meaning `controller error (NEC for floppies)`. after debugging found `dl` should be `0x80`. but then the error was `0x02` meaning `address mark not found or bad sector`.
