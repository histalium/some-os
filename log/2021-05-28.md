## loop

wiht `jmp` you jump to a other location. in the case lable `loop`.

this
```asm
loop:
    jmp loop
```

compiles to

```
EB FE
```

`EB` is a short jump. it jumps the next signed byte. `FE` is `-2`. `IP` points to the next instruction. `EB` instruction is 2 bytes, that's where the `-2` comes from.

## assembly

* `jmp` jump to a location like a lable.
* `int` interrupt
* `move` set to a value
* `cmp` compare 2 values
* `je` jump if 2 values are equal
* `db` data
* `add` add a value

## print text

to print text on the screen a `int 0x10` is needed. `ah` is `0x0e` for `teletype output` and `al` is the character to be printed. more info at [VIDEO - TELETYPE OUTPUT](http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-0106.htm).

```asm
mov ah, 0x0e
mov al, 'H'
int 0x10 
```

## add color

to be able to use color the `video mode` must be of type `graphics`. to change the `video mode` do `int 0x10` where `ah` is `0x00` and `al` the `video mode`. `video mode` `0x12` has `16/256K` colors. more info at [VIDEO - SET VIDEO MODE](http://www.ctyme.com/intr/rb-0069.htm#Table10). when printing the character the color can be set with `bl`

```asm
; change video mode
mov ah, 0x00
mov al, 0x12
int 0x10

; print 'H'
mov ah, 0x0e
mov al, 'H'
mov bl, 0x02  ; green text
int 0x10 
```

# data

data is added with `db`. with a lable you can point to its location.

```asm
g:
    db "G"
```

to put the value at the memory location `[]` is added around the lable.

```asm
mov al, [g]
```

# boot sector

the boot sector is loaded at address `0x7c00`. because of this the value of the lables location is wrong at compile time. to fix this a `global offset` must be set with `org` at the beginning of the code.

```asm
[org 0x7c00]
```

# pixel

to draw a pixel do `int 0x10` where `ah` is `0x0c`. `al` is the color and `cx` and `dx` are the `column` and the `row`.

```asm
; draw green pixel at 0x32, 0x64
mov ah, 0x0c
mov al, 0x02
mov cx, 0x32
mov dx, 0x64
int 0x10
```
