## Write to video memory

on boot display starts on `vga` in `80x25 text mode`. video memory starts at `0xb0000`. characters are 2 bytes long. the first byte is ascii value and the second the color. to set the values in memory at that address `segmentation` must be used.

```asm
mov ax, 0xb000
mov es, ax
mov ax, 0x8000
mov bl, 0x5a
mov [es:0x8000], bl
mov bl, 0x5a
mov [es:0x8001], bl
```
