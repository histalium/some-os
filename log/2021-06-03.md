## load code

there was a problem with loading sector 3. to fix it the size of the bin file was extended to `1474562 bytes`. and the drive changed to `floppy` with `-drive "format=raw,file=bin/boot_sect_simple.bin,if=floppy"`. then the data could be loaded with this code.

```asm
mov bx, 0x9000  ; mem location
mov ah, 0x02    ; read int 0x13
mov al, 0x01    ; read 1 sector
mov cl, 0x03    ; sector to read
mov ch, 0x00    ; cylinder to read
mov dh, 0x00    ; head to read
mov dl, 0x00    ; drive number
int 0x13        ; read from disk
```

the data is loaded at `0x9000`. and can be executed with this code.

```asm
mov eax, 0x00009000
call eax
```
