## segments

segments are used to add a offset to the addresses. the segment register is shifted 4 bits to the left and added to the address value. for example if `es` is `0xf0`, then `[es:0x20]` is `[0xf20]`. the segment rigisters are `cs` (code segment), `ds` (data segment), extra segments `es`, `fs`, `gs` and `ss` (stack segment).

```asm
mov al, [0x01]
```

decompiles to

```
A0 01 00
```

and with `es` a `26` is added before

```asm
mov al, [es:0x01]
```

decompiles to

```
26 A0 01 00
```

## reading from disk

to read from disk a `int 0x13` with `ah` with value `0x02` is needed. `al` is the number of sectors, `cl` the sector to read, `ch` the cylinder to read and `dh` the head to read. see [INT 13,2 - Read Disk Sectors](https://stanislavs.org/helppc/int_13-2.html) for more info.

```asm
mov bx, 0x9000  ; mem location
mov ah, 0x02    ; read int 0x13
mov al, 0x01    ; read 1 sector
mov cl, 0x02    ; sector to read
mov ch, 0x00    ; cylinder to read
mov dh, 0x00    ; head to read
int 0x13        ; read from disk
```
