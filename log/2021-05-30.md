## segments

segments are used to add a offset to the addresses. the segment register is shifted 4 bits to the left and added to the address value. for example if `es` is `0xf0`, then `[es:0x20]` is `[0xf20]`. the segment rigisters are `cs` (code segment), `ds` (data segment), extra segments `es`, `fs`, `gs` and `ss` (stack segment).

```asm
mov al, [0x01]
```

decompiles to

```
A0 01 00
```

and with `es` a `26` is added before

```asm
mov al, [es:0x01]
```

decompiles to

```
26 A0 01 00
```
